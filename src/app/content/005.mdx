We often glorify the grand moments in narratives of social change. The revolutions,
the protests, the wars.

But what if I tell you that social change is not born from an explosion 
but from the spark of a match?

In complex systems, small nudges can ripple to enormous effects. Take Conway's 
Game of Life: how can a simple arrangement lead to such intricate, animated patterns?

The initial configuration is the spark from which intricate patterns emerge.

What if we do the same? Design small interventions that, over time, ripple 
into true systemic change.

After all, every revolution begins with a conversation.

Social change doesnâ€™t need to begin with a battle cry; it can start from a simple "hello".
