How we talk about reality is such a fragile thing.

Is light a particle or a wave? Is our economy for innovation or exploitation? 
Is society meritocratic or unjust?

When we all break down our epistemic frameworks, we begin to see them
as models. Different models that perceive the same phenonemon but explain
it differently. Someone would perceive poverty as a personal failing; 
others would perceive it as a result of systemic issues beyond the individual.
Both models have their own assumptions just as mathematics has axioms and 
models have parameters. 

All models are wrong but some are useful.
