I don't know the path forward anymore.

I naively believed in the institutions that promised the pursuit of 
intellectual curiosities. Now, that I'm here, it does feel like that
but a more performative, sanitized version of that.

I am unsure whether the problem is the system or if it's me. Maybe, I'm
just not cut out for this. Because while I am crumbling in the system 
that dismantles me, other people seem to enjoy it--thriving even. 

I'm a blizzard of impostor syndrome, disillusionment, and lonely isolation
wrapped all at once.
