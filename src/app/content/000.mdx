This is not a blog. This is not a notebook.  
This is something *different*.

Fragments of thoughts that complement the main piece.  
Fragments of thoughts left unsaid, yet building meaning atom by atom.  
Fragments of thoughts suspended between knowing and becoming.

<a href="#margins" className="group cursor-pointer">
  <div className="italic text-gray-600 group-hover:text-black transition">
    Scroll through the quiet. Scroll through the corners.  
    Scroll through what lingers after the thought has been fully realized.
  </div>
</a>

</Fragment>
