<Fragment thesis="Is tech-enabled populism a global trend?" createdAt="06/03/2025 04:55 PM">
It's bizarre how the Philippines and the US are both experiencing similar trends of
anti-intellectualism, populism and conservative ideologies.

Makes you wonder if this is a global trend and what factors led to this. Are social
media platforms to blame? Is ideology embedded in these systems? Do the design silently 
(or perhaps even blatantly) contribute to this turbulent state? What does this tell us 
about power in a globalized society if the US shoved their technocratic supremacy
onto developing countries especially in a post-colonial context like in the Philippines?

I have so many questions.
