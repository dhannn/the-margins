Knowledge is a graph. Just as much as reality is.

And when you learn, you traverse the graph one by one. A course may take you to 
one cluster of vertices. Another course may take you to nodes on the opposite side.

Sometimes, you construct new nodes and edges, and reconstruct existing ones.

But sometimes, a singular experience catapults you unto a higher perspective. 
A perspective where everything--every concept, every ideas--collapses into singularity.

And like an astronaut looking down, you see the whole intricacies of the graph.
How elegantly it is formed. How beautifully it's fully connected.
