<Fragment thesis="Power can be invisible." createdAt="05/18/2025 12:30 PM">
Power needs not to be coercive. It does not need to shout or strain or clutch with an iron fist. 

Sometimes, power is as subtle as suggesting that humanities is not worth studying. 

It's as subtle as living in and tending to a system that favors the coldness of the sciences, leaving no warmth of empathy and kindness. 

It's the slow, dying erosion of critical thinking, healthy communication and the masterful art of creative re-envisioning—deconstructing and reconstructing. 

People feel the visceral pain of the system—no matter where your politics lies—but they do not have the tools to process it because people in power have taken those away. Locked in ivory towers—or burned, erased, even killed—when it dares reach the masses

Education—the holistic kind and not the cheap copy born out of neoliberal society—liberates people from this ache. It empowers them. It brings power back to the people.
