Being a ladderized BSMS student is weird.

This past year felt like I live in some liminal space--not quite undergrad student, 
not quite graduate student. 

People have expectations when you're a grad student but, because you've only 
been an undegrad since what felt like yesterday, you feel like you don't live up to 
that role yet.

Until you slowly acclimate to it. With every paper added to Zotero. With every
new coursework. With every conferences or events you browsed. And applied.
With every online video or lecture you watch about your topic. 

With every performance, you gain confidence.

And now, I feel like I'm living on the precipice.
