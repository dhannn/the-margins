We lost the art of anticipation. 

Handwritten letters used to take days even months before it reaches another soul.
In the space between we carve solitudes while we make room for their presence
even when intangible.

We walk our days not beside them but carrying them within our thoughts, a kind of
intimacy lost within the fact-paced, convenient world we're in.
